# CS282R Tensorflow Workshop
A tensorflow tutorial for CS282R: Robust Machine Learning taught at Harvard University in Spring 2018.

## Overview
This workshop covers the fundamentals of TensorFlow. By the end of this workshop, you will be ready to start building your own neural network models in TensorFlow.
The workshop will start from by reviewing concepts unique to TensorFlow coding, e.g. sessions, variables, optimizers.
Later, we'll put these concepts together to build logistic regression, 3-layer NN, and GAN.

The side theme of this workshop is writing clean, structured and well-documented code. ML code tends to get messy. This is especially the case in academic settings where we don't have a manager to review your code. We are also free from the pressure that our code will be used by millions of people. BUT, this never means that you can write sloppy code. The code should be nicely written so that you, three months from now, should be able to come back to the code and tell exactly what each function is doing.

That said, my code is not the best thing in the world. If you find any improvements, or errors in the code, please let me know. Pull requests are always welcome.

## Prerequisite
- Comfortability with Python
- Understanding of basic machine learning concepts e.g. cross entropy loss, back propagation, 3-layer fully connected neural network. You can definitely google along if some of these concepts are shaky.
