# CS282R Tensorflow Workshop
A tensorflow tutorial for CS282R: Robust Machine Learning taught at Harvard University in Spring 2018.

## Overview
This workshop covers the fundamentals of TensorFlow. By the end of this workshop, you will be ready to start building your own neural network models in TensorFlow.

## Prerequisite
- Comfortability with Python
- Understanding of basic machine learning concepts e.g. cross entropy loss, back propagation, 3-layer fully connected neural network. You can definitely google along if some of these concepts are shaky.
